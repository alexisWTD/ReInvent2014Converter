					<span class="title">Device Clouds: Best Practices in Building a Connected Device Backend in the Cloud</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">The more devices are connected, the more new applications and services emerge that use those connected devices. AWS offers a wide variety of services that can be used to build &quot;device clouds,&quot; backend infrastructure for connecting different kinds of devices, including smart phones, tablets, smart meters, connected cars, sensor and actuator gateways, and so on. In this session, we share best practices for authentication, authorization, messaging, data collection, analytics, and much more. We also hear from Internet of Things (IoT) customers who have successfully built highly-scalable device clouds on AWS.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Cross-platform push notifications that can engage your customers even when your app is in the background are becoming a central part of a mobile app user experience. Some customers may rarely open an app that provides useful information to them; for them, the notifications are the most important part. But great user experiences can break if your messages get dropped or delayed. How do you ensure your messages are delivered fast and reliably at scale? And how can you use them to extend the user experience of your app? In this session, we show you how Amazon SNS provides the performance and simplicity of a managed service, while also supporting interactive notifications, silent push, and broadcasts to large groups. We also learn from Mailbox, who rely on large-scale push notifications as a core part of the user experience, and who will share real-world design patterns.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">In the past, content and preferences would be moved to the device. Now devices are just a window to content and services that live in the cloud. The cloud enables your content and preferences to follow you wherever you go. You have the ability to transition between your phone, tablet, and laptop and seamlessly pick up where you left off. With Amazon Cognito, you can synchronize user data across mobile OS/devices and bridge the web world with the mobile world. In this session, learn how you can implement sync in Android, iOS, and JavaScript so you can deliver a &ldquo;WOW&rdquo; customized user experience to your customers. We show you how to integrate with Amazon Cognito to sync with mobile devices and the web and delve into some of the nuances of syncing, such as conflict resolution and account merging.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">In this session, hear directly from HTC and EasyTaxi, who share their architecture stories of how they built powerful mobile backend services on AWS. Learn how HTC built a news aggregation service (BlinkFeed), a photo-sharing service (HTC Share), and a phone backup service (HTC Backup) on AWS. Also learn how they used AWS for deploying server code, provisioning handsets, and business intelligence, and how they launched these services worldwide, with high availability and low latency in just 6 months.
EasyTaxi is building the world&rsquo;s largest taxi mobile app. EasyTaxi shares their experience building an app as they scaled to 35+ countries and thousands of transactions per second. They discuss how they had to reinvent their architecture and infrastructure to meet several cultural as well technical challenges such as adapting to different kinds of access, mobile networks, and working with different charsets to change server locations. They share best practices on how they met the demanding traffic and transactional workloads by building on AWS and leveraging help from Amazon Enterprise Support.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Learn how to build a powerful iOS app that leverages a variety of AWS services. In this three-hour, demo-heavy workshop, we show how you can build a modern native client app using Apple Swift and the AWS Mobile SDK that uses a number of cross-platform mobile cloud services directly with minimal code on the client. We share best practices for building a highly scalable backend so you can add your own functionality.
