					<span class="title">Performance Benchmarking on AWS</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">In this session, we explain how to measure the key performance-impacting metrics in a cloud-based application and best practices for a reliable benchmarking process. Measuring the performance of applications correctly can be challenging and there are many tools available to measure and track performance. This session will provide you with specific examples of good and bad tests. We make it clear how to get reliable measurements of and how to map benchmark results to your application. We also cover the importance of selecting tests wisely, repeating tests, and measuring variability. In addition a customer will provide real-life examples of how they developed their application testing stack, utilize it for repeatable testing and identify bottlenecks.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">You can&rsquo;t (yet) bend the law of Physics, but you can use the power of the cloud to design applications that run as fast as the speed of light! This session will focus on the best practices for optimizing performance to the very last millisecond. We&rsquo;ll dive into topics such as caching at every layer of your application, TCP optimizations, SSL optimizations, latency based routing, and much more. These best practices can help you to streamline your infrastructure utilization, improve performance and allow you to scale economically.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Complex distributed systems fail. They fail more frequently, and in different ways, as they scale and evolve over time. In this session, you learn how Netflix embraces failure to provide high service availability. Netflix discusses their motivations for inducing failure in production, the mechanics of how Netflix does this, and the lessons they learned along the way. Come hear about the Failure Injection Testing (FIT) framework and suite of tools that Netflix created and currently uses to induce controlled system failures in an effort to help discover vulnerabilities, resolve them, and improve the resiliency of their cloud environment.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Netflix tunes Amazon EC2 instances for maximum performance. In this session, you learn how Netflix configures the fastest possible EC2 instances, while reducing latency outliers. This session explores the various Xen modes (e.g., HVM, PV, etc.) and how they are optimized for different workloads. Hear how Netflix chooses Linux kernel versions based on desired performance characteristics and receive a firsthand look at how they set kernel tunables, including hugepages.&nbsp;You also hear about Netflix&rsquo;s use of SR-IOV to enable enhanced networking and their approach to observability, which can exonerate EC2 issues and direct attention back to application performance.

					<span class="title">Auto Scaling: A Machine Learning Approach</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Auto Scaling groups used in conjunction with auto-scaling policies define when to scale out or scale in instances. These policies define actionable states based on a defined event and time frame (e.g., add instance when CPU utilization is greater than 90% for 5 consecutive minutes). In this session, Electronic Arts (EA) discusses a pro-active approach to scaling.&nbsp;You learn how to analyze past resource usage to help pre-emptively determine when to add or remove instances for a given launch configuration. Past data is retrieved via Amazon CloudWatch APIs, and the application of supervised machine learning models and time series smoothing is discussed.</span>
