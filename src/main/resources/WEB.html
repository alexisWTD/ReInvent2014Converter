				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Log data contains some of the most valuable raw information you can gather and analyze about your infrastructure and applications. &nbsp;Amid the mess of confusing lines of seemingly random text can be hints about performance, security, flaws in code, user access patterns, and other operational data. Without the proper tools, finding insights in these logs can be like searching for a hay-colored needle in a haystack. &nbsp;In this session you learn&nbsp;what practices and patterns you can easily implement that can help you better understand your log files. You see how you can customize web logs to add more information to them, how to digest logs from around your infrastructure, and how to analyze your log files in near real time. &nbsp;

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Magento is a leading open source, eCommerce platform used by many global brands. However, architecting your Magento platform to grow with your business can sometimes be a challenge. This session walks through the steps needed to take an out-of-the-box, single-node Magento implementation and turn it into a highly available, elastic, and robust deployment. This includes an end-to-end caching strategy that provides an efficient front-end cache (including populated shopping carts) using Varnish on Amazon EC2 as well as offloading the Magento caches to separate infrastructure such as Amazon ElastiCache. We also look at strategies to manage the Magento Media library outside of the application instances, including EC2-based shared storage solutions and Amazon S3. At the data layer we look at Magento-specific Amazon RDS&ndash;tuning strategies including configuring Magento to use read replicas for horizontal scalability. Finally, we look at proven techniques to manage your Magento implementation at scale, including tips on cache draining, appropriate cache separation, and utilizing AWS CloudFormation to manage your infrastructure and orchestrate predictable deployments.</span>
