					<span class="title">How Technology is Transforming Education</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">The implementation of highly scalable, easy-to-deploy technology is radically transforming educational models and student engagement. Many companies have used cloud computing to innovate in ways that have significantly improved the student experience.&nbsp;AWS has been an integral part of the strategies and solutions of these companies, from inception to large-scale growth to market leadership.&nbsp;In this session, Echo 360 and Chegg show how they use AWS services&mdash;such as Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Auto Scaling&mdash;to dynamically scale and allocate resources based on the school year and cyclical nature of their businesses.&nbsp;They discuss globalization, privacy, PCI compliance, and cost efficiency. Learn how you can apply their insights to your own educational and business models.</span>

					<span class="title">Enterprise Cloud Adoption Strategies in Higher Education</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">We have reached a tipping point in enterprise cloud adoption in higher education institutions. Many large research universities have now taken on various cloud projects, touching almost every aspect of their enterprise. One excellent example of this is Harvard University. Over the course of the past 18 months, Harvard University IT (HUIT) has been investigating, developing, and implementing an enterprise-scale cloud adoption program. This session presents HUIT's efforts to date, including approaches to vision, strategy, culture, education, staffing, and technology. The session also includes examples from other major universities. You'll receive practical advice about how to begin the adoption journey, and you'll learn about frameworks that can help you make decisions in the context of your own institutional environment.</span>

					<span class="title">Instructing on the Cloud: Using AWS to Aid Professors and Teach Students</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">In the past, academic institutions and departments&mdash;primarily those focused on computer science, information systems, or other technology instruction&mdash;have made significant use of on-premises servers for labs, projects, and research efforts. Many of these institutions are now migrating from their on-premises environments to the cloud. They are providing computational support for coursework and back-end support for capstone projects, all while enhancing their cloud curriculum to create the next generation of IT innovators.&nbsp;In this session, learn how faculty can implement multi-user environments in the classroom; access AWS assets such as AWS credits, training resources, content, and labs; and collaborate on content creation and shared Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Hear about best practices and case studies for implementing AWS in the classroom and in academic research. This session is an opportunity for representatives from academia to learn how they can leverage cloud computing to aid them in coursework development and research.</span>
