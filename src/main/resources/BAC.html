				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">In this session, you learn how Inova Translational Medicine Institute (ITMI) uses Amazon S3 together with an on-premises cloud gateway from Avere Systems to take advantage of the unlimited capacity scaling in the cloud while lowering the cost of data storage. ITMI describes how they worked together with AWS and Avere Systems to deploy a highly available, secure and scalable data storage solution for managing its database of 5000 complete whole genome sequences. You hear how ITMI&rsquo;s hybrid cloud storage solution works together with their integrated environment and allows them to tie together disparate systems and treat the cloud as an on-premises data center, without the maintenance overhead.

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">In the event of a disaster, you need to be able to recover lost data quickly to ensure business continuity. For critical applications, keeping your time to recover and data loss to a minimum as well as optimizing your overall capital expense can be challenging.
This session presents AWS features and services along with Disaster Recovery architectures that you can leverage when building highly available and disaster resilient applications. We will provide recommendations on how to improve your Disaster Recovery plan and discuss example scenarios showing how to recover from a disaster. 
We will also include a real life customer example of a deployment using AWS for High Availability and Disaster Recovery.

					<span class="title">Building an Enterprise-Class Backup and Archive Storage Solution Using AWS</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">In this session, Druva&rsquo;s technical founder shares how the company has used AWS to bring scalable and efficient data backup and archival services to market at scale. 
&nbsp;
Druva has built a scalable storage-as-a-service platform in the cloud, designed to collect, preserve, and help enterprises easily discover information masquerading as &ldquo;just some data.&rdquo; Druva leveraged Amazon S3 for a large pool of distributed storage for warm copies of data, Amazon Glacier for long-term preservation, and a metadata layer on top of Amazon DynamoDB for high transaction and fast data deduplication. The system is uniquely designed like a file system, so developers can write an application with the same basic assumptions. Druva used the design principles of metadata and data separation and deployed the concept of &ldquo;microthreads&rdquo; to counter latency challenges. The result is a completely distributed cloud-oriented architecture that is geodistributed, highly available, and able to scale to manage massive volumes of data across multiple customers and geographies. Even if your attention is not particularly on backup solutions, it will be instructive to learn how Druva is taking advantage of these AWS services at massive scale.
This session is targeted at developers and at technical and product leaders interested in ways to use AWS in enterprise environments.
