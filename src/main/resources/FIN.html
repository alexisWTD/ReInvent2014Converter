				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Jason Timmes led the migration of the primary data warehouse for Nasdaq&rsquo;s Transaction Services U.S. business unit (which operates Nasdaq&rsquo;s U.S. equity and options exchanges) from a traditional on-premises MPP database to Amazon Redshift. The project significantly reduced operational expenses. Jason, who is an Associate Vice President of Software Development at Nasdaq, describes how his team migrated a warehouse that loads approximately 7 billion rows a day into the cloud, satisfied several security and regulatory audits, optimized read and write performance, ensures high availability, and orchestrates other back-office activities that depend on the warehouse daily loads completing. Along with sharing several technical lessons learned, Jason will discuss Nasdaq&rsquo;s roadmap to integrating Redshift with more AWS services, as well as with more Nasdaq products, to offer even greater benefit to clients (internal and external) in the months ahead.</span>
