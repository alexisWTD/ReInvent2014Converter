					<span class="title">Using AWS and Data Science to Analyze Vaccine Yield</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Producing vaccines is a significant and complex effort that spans manufacturing, biological materials, streaming data, and complex computational challenges. In this session, speakers from Merck and Booz Allen Hamilton discuss how they partnered to leverage AWS and data science techniques, enabling them to pioneer new approaches for analyzing vaccine production yields. The solution they created combines a shared data lake service built on AWS services&mdash;such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC&mdash;as well as Hadoop MapReduce, HDFS, Hive, and R to implement the data science infrastructure and analysis that created models of complex biological processes. As a result of this project, Merck has analyzed 12 years of vaccine manufacturing data from 16 data sources, conducted over 15 billion calculations, and was recognized with the InformationWeek Elite Business Innovation Award for the innovative application of data science towards enhancing vaccine yield rates and saving lives.</span>

					<span class="title">How Cloud Computing is Redefining Research: Secure, Collaborative Science at Scale</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Genome sequencing technologies have lowered costs and increased data output at a much faster rate than traditional hardware refresh cycles can service effectively. With lowered costs, more biomedical research and clinical operations are integrating sequencing into a larger portion of their projects, compounding an already tough problem for IT operations. When Regeneron committed to using Next Generation Sequencing technology for biopharmaceutical research, the decision was made to keep the server room empty and deliver all genomic analysis and storage services using AWS and DNAnexus. We review the consequences of this decision, illustrating how basic AWS core services are game-changers in the design and operation of a scientific infrastructure at scale. We show how Amazon S3 changes the storage performance equation, discuss the impact of new instance types on the cost of genomic analysis, and explain how secure collaboration enables Regeneron to advance biopharmaceutical research techniques and support the future of genomic medicine.</span>

					<span class="title">Building a Secure and Scalable Healthcare Platform</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Healthcare and life sciences companies depend on thousands of dissimilar data streams from a complicated array of sources for all aspects of their businesses. The complexity of managing this data can present challenges in understanding and engaging patients and providers, effectively managing clinical trials, making data-driven decisions, and developing intelligent insights. In this session, we show how IMS Health uses AWS services (AWS Data Pipeline, Amazon EC2, Amazon Glacier, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Route 53, and Amazon S3) to address the healthcare needs of its customers. In addition, we show how IMS Health uses AWS today to optimize the integration of sales and marketing activities through customer use cases. Find out how both applications and data services will improve as access to data is accelerated and new capabilities are delivered through Amazon Redshift.&nbsp;</span>

					<span class="title">Transforming Cancer Treatment: Integrating Data to Deliver on the Promise of Precision Medicine</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">In the past ten years, the cost of sequencing a human genome has fallen from $3 billion dollars to $1,000, unlocking the ability for clinicians to use genomics in routine care. As the volume of genomic data used in the clinic begins to grow, healthcare providers are facing a number of new IT challenges, such as how to integrate this data with clinical data stored in electronic medical records, and how to make both available in real time to inform clinical decisions.&nbsp;In this session, find out how UCSF Medical Center and Syapse met these challenges head-on and solved them using AWS, all while remaining compliant with privacy and security requirements. Learn how Syapse&rsquo;s precision medicine platform uses Amazon VPC, Dedicated Instances, Amazon EC2, and Amazon EBS to build a high performance, scalable, and HIPAA-compliant data platform that enables UCSF to deliver on the promise of precision medicine by dramatically reducing time and increasing the accuracy and utility of genomic profiling in cancer treatment.&nbsp;</span>

					<span class="title">Architecting for HIPAA Compliance on AWS</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">This session brings together the interests of engineering, compliance, and security experts, and shows you how to align your AWS workload to the controls in the HIPAA Security Rule. You hear from customers who process and store Protected Health Information (PHI) on AWS, and you learn how they satisfied their compliance requirements while maintaining agility. This session helps security and compliance experts find out what is technically possible on AWS and learn how implementing the Technical Safeguards in the HIPAA Security Rule can be simple and familiar. We walk through the Technical Safeguards of the Security Rule and map them to AWS features and design choices to help developers, operations teams, and engineers speak the language of their security and compliance peers.</span>

					<span class="title">Getting into Your Genes: The Definitive Guide to Using Amazon EMR, Amazon ElastiCache, and Amazon S3 to Deliver High-Performance, Scientific Applications</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">The key to fighting cancer through better therapeutics is a deep understanding of the basic biology of this disease at a cellular and molecular level.&nbsp;Comprehensive analysis of cancer mutations in specific tumors or cancer cell lines by using Life Technologies sequencing and real-time PCR systems generates&nbsp;gigabytes to terabytes of data every day. Our customers bring together this data in studies that seek to discover the genetic fingerprint of cancer. The data typically translates to&nbsp;millions of records in databases&nbsp;that require&nbsp;complex algorithmic processing, cross-application analysis, and interactive visualizations with real-time response&nbsp;(2-3 seconds) to enable users to consume large volumes of complex scientific information.
We have chosen the AWS platform to bring this new era of data analysis power to our customers by using technologies such as Amazon S3, ElastiCache, and DynamoDB for storage and fast access and Amazon EMR for parallelizing complex computations. Our talk tells the story&nbsp;with rich&nbsp;details about challenges and roadblocks in building data-intense, highly interactive applications in the cloud. We also highlight enhanced customer&nbsp;workflows&nbsp;and highly optimized applications with orders of magnitude improvement in performance and&nbsp;scalability.&nbsp;</span>
