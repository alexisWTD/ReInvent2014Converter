In this session, we focus on how you can get your existing infrastructure robustly represented in Chef. We dive deep on all the specifics that make deploying with Chef on AWS easy: authentication management, versioning, recipe testing, and leveraging AWS resources in your recipes. Whether you're building new infrastructure with no existing operations management software or deploying existing Chef recipes into AWS, this session will outline all the tips and tricks you need to be a master Chef in the cloud.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">If you have tried Docker but are unsure about how to run it at scale, you will benefit from this session. Like virtualization before, containerization (&agrave; la Docker) is increasing the elastic nature of cloud infrastructure by an order of magnitude.&nbsp; But maybe you still have questions: How many containers can you run on a given Amazon EC2 instance type? Which metric should you look at to measure contention? How do you manage fleets of containers at scale?
Datadog is a monitoring service for IT, operations, and development teams who write and run applications at scale. In this session, the cofounder of Datadog presents the challenges and benefits of running containers at scale and how to use quantitative performance patterns to monitor your infrastructure at this magnitude and complexity.

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">How can you reliably schedule tasks in an unreliable, autoscaling cloud environment? This presentation talks about the design of our Fenzo scheduler, built on Apache Mesos, that serves as the core of our stream-processing platform, Mantis, designed for real-time insights. We focus on the following aspects of the scheduler:
&nbsp; - Resource granularity
&nbsp; - Fault tolerance&nbsp;
&nbsp; - Bin packing, task affinity, stream locality&nbsp;
&nbsp; - Autoscaling of the cluster and of individual service jobs
&nbsp; - Constraints (hard and soft) for individual tasks such as zone balancing, unique, and exclusive instances
This talk also includes detailed information on a holistic approach to scheduling in a distributed, autoscaling environment to achieve both speed and advanced scheduling optimizations.</span>
