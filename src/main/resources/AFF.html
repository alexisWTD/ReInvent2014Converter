				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Not sure when (or if) to run a sale? Not sure what IAP items to offer?&nbsp;In this session, Playtika EVP Salim Mitha and Amazon show you what works. We&nbsp;share best practices and analytics data that we've aggregated from the top 50 in-app purchase (IAP) grossing games in the Amazon Appstore. &nbsp;We cover user retention and engagement data comparisons and examine several purchasing UI layouts to learn how to manage and present IAP item selection. We also cover how to manage IAP price points and how and when to tailor price variety, sales, and offers for customers. You get actionable data and&nbsp;suggestions&nbsp;that you can use on your current as well as future projects to help&nbsp;maximize IAP revenue.&nbsp;</span>
