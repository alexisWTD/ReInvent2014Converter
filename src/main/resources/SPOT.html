Every year, we outpace the previous year in launches and are continuously accelerating the pace of innovation across the organization. In this session, Charlie Bell, Sr. Vice President of Engineering, will share how his teams are able to formulate customer-centric ideas, turn them into features and services, and get them to market quickly.&nbsp;This session dives deep into how an idea becomes a service at AWS and how we continue to evolve the service after release through innovation at every level. We will then walk through some real-world examples of how we applied these concepts to launch a new AWS service. Come learn about the rapid pace of innovation at AWS, and the culture that formulates magic behind the scenes.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">This session, led by James Hamilton, VP &amp;Distinguished Engineer, gives an insider view of some the innovations that help make the AWS cloud unique. He will show examples of AWS networking innovations from the interregional network backbone, through custom routers and networking protocol stack, all the way down to individual servers. He will show examples from AWS server hardware, storage, and power distribution and then, up the stack, in high scale streaming data processing. James will also dive into fundamental database work AWS is delivering to open up scaling and performance limits, reduce costs, and eliminate much of the administrative burden of managing databases. Join this session and walk away with a deeper understanding of the underlying innovations powering the cloud.</span>

					<span class="title">Under the Covers of AWS: Core Distributed Systems Primitives That Power Our Platform</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">AWS and Amazon.com operate some of the world&rsquo;s largest distributed systems infrastructure and applications. In our past 18 years of operating&nbsp;this infrastructure, we have come to realize that building such large distributed systems to meet the durability, reliability, scalability, and performance needs of AWS requires us to build our services using a few common distributed systems primitives. Examples of these primitives include a reliable method to build consensus in a distributed system, reliable and scalable key-value store, infrastructure for a transactional logging system, scalable database query layers using both NoSQL and SQL APIs, and a system for scalable and elastic compute infrastructure.
In this session, we discuss some of the solutions that we employ in building these primitives and our lessons in operating these systems. We also cover the history of some of these primitives &ndash; DHTs, transactional logging, materialized views and various other deep distributed systems concepts; how their design evolved over time; and how we continue to scale them to AWS.&nbsp;</span>

					<span class="abstract">The heart of any service is its availability. Even the coolest game, mobile app, or website is hard to love if users can't rely on it to be available when they need it the most. In this session, we dive deep into how we think about availability of services at AWS and the measures we take to maximize our availability at scale: starting from multi-datacenter services to our deployment methodology, canaries, and fault tolerance in general. In this session, you will get a comprehensive view of how different organizations think about availability and the tradeoffs we make on our way to building highly available services.&nbsp;</span>

				</a>
        
          <label style="color:#F5851F;">Just Added!</label>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">An increasingly common form of computing is computation in response to recently occurring events. These might be newly arrived or changed data, such as an uploaded Amazon S3 image file or an update to an Amazon&nbsp;DynamoDB table, or they might be changes in the state of some system or service, such as termination of an EC2 instance. Support for this form of computing requires both a means of efficiently surfacing events as a sequence of&nbsp;change records,&nbsp;as well as frameworks for processing such&nbsp;change logs. This session provides an overview of how AWS intends to facilitate event-driven computing through support for both change logs as well as various means of processing them.</span>
