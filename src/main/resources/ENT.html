					<span class="title">New Generation Hybrid Architectures with Suncorp, NetApp, and AWS</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Suncorp is Australia&rsquo;s largest insurance provider and leading regional bank, with 15,000 employees, $96 billion in assets, and 9 million customers across Australia and New Zealand. Last year, the company announced intentions to move its entire infrastructure to AWS.
In this session, a Suncorp cloud architect discusses the hybrid IT approach that allows Suncorp to use AWS while satisfying strict IT compliance requirements. He shares the thinking, challenges and roadmap related to Suncorp&rsquo;s use of NetApp Private Storage (NPS)&nbsp;for AWS for enterprise-wide disaster recovery, dual data centers for redundancy and compliance, and plans for enterprisewide production workloads in phase two of the company's cloud transition. Learn why making application architecture changes and moving workloads to AWS is quicker and easier when your on-premises storage platform is consistent with your cloud storage platform. Session includes a demo of the NPS&nbsp;for AWS solution used by Suncorp as well as a discussion of the latest public and hybrid cloud developments available to customers. Sponsored by NetApp.

					<span class="abstract">In 2013, leading global energy company, Hess Corporation announced it was exiting its downstream businesses to focus on a higher growth portfolio of Exploration and Production (E&P) assets. With obligations to deliver functioning and operational IT infrastructure to the buyers and little time for redesign, Hess leveraged AWS to establish a repeatable, cloud escrow model which enabled them to rapidly migrate a large and diverse application inventory.
This session provides the technical aspects and unique insights into enterprise cloud adoption challenges and how Hess and Nimbo were able to successfully overcome them by relying on the flexibility and scale of AWS.</span>

					<span class="abstract">For governments, the cloud offers not only cost savings and agility, but the opportunity to develop breakthroughs in research, accelerate economic development and innovation, and enable &quot;the always-up, always-on&quot; infrastructure necessary to support critical missions. National and local governments are coping with the dual challenges of constrained budgets and human resources along with strict information security regimes. Many agencies and organizations are attracted to web services rather than on premises hardware, both for the cost benefits and for agility they offer.
This session provides an overview of the use cases ranging from offloading simple websites to running parallel test environments to migrating major enterprise production applications to the cloud&mdash;all of them balancing security and compliance with economy and access. Examples from FINRA, UCAS, the government of Singapore, and the US Department of Health and Human Services highlight the significant transformative impact of cloud architectures including Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon CloudFront and Amazon DynamoDB. Learn the practical strategies being deployed by governments worldwide to break down innovation barriers and tackle mission-critical operations with the cloud.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Given the distributed nature of today&rsquo;s workforce, many IT organizations must support branch offices and remote sites. These multiple sites create islands of infrastructure that are necessary to meet local performance and reliability needs, but are costly to manage and increase the risks associated with distributed data. Consolidation is key to reducing costs and eliminating risks, but how do customers leverage the power of AWS as part of this consolidation? Riverbed SteelFusion is a converged infrastructure solution, encompassing server, projected storage, networking, and WAN optimization. When combined with AWS Storage Gateway, SteelFusion allows customers to connect their on-premises infrastructure to AWS. Session attendees will learn how to leverage WAN Optimization and Projected Storage technologies as part of their IT strategy to consolidate and provide disaster recovery for branch offices and remote sites.

You'll be diving into the deep end of hybrid environments, and that means taking a broad view of your IT strategy, architecture, and organizational design.
Through our experience in helping enterprises navigate this change, AWS has developed the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) to assist with planning, creating, managing, and supporting the shift. In this session, we cover how the CAF offers practical guidance and comprehensive guidelines to enterprise organizations, particularly around roles, governance, and efficiency.</span>

					<span class="abstract">The public cloud IaaS and PaaS markets are moving at a tremendous speed, and delivering innovative, differentiated services at rapidly-decreasing costs. Yet many IT organizations nevertheless believe that they would prefer to build a private cloud, or have one custom-built for them. Furthermore, the desires of IT Operations and Application Development often clash. Buyers must not only choose a solution that meets their current needs, but figure out how to meet their future needs, too. We'll discuss how to determine a strategy and source the capabilities you need.
