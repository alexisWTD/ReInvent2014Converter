					<span class="title">A Tale of One Thousand Instances - Migrating from Amazon EC2-Classic to VPC</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">In this session, you learn why Twilio chose to migrate from Amazon EC2-Classic to VPC and how they leveraged features available only in VPC, specifically:
- AWS CloudHSM: Build out a secure key encryption or role-based access control for internal use; also used to securely store and encrypt data for external customers.- Elastic Network Interface (ENI):&nbsp; Allows multiple Elastic IPs per instance and the ability to move network interface between instances.- Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM) instances w/SRV-IO: New hardware virtualized instances that allow line-level performance of network interfaces for up to 10g Ethernet speeds. Secure data-in-transit by default, which ensures all machines communicate via a software-defined network and work in the same manner as VLAN tagging for compliance reasons. Sponsored by Twilio.

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Amazon Elastic MapReduce is one of the largest Hadoop operators in the world. Since its launch five years ago, AWS customers have launched more than 5.5 million Hadoop clusters. In this talk, we introduce you to Amazon EMR design patterns such as using Amazon S3 instead of HDFS, taking advantage of both long and short-lived clusters and other Amazon EMR architectural patterns. We talk about how to scale your cluster up or down dynamically and introduce you to ways you can fine-tune your cluster. We also share best practices to keep your Amazon EMR cluster cost efficient.</span>

          <label style="color:#F5851F;">Just Added!</label>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Dynamo Streams provides a stream of all the updates done to your DynamoDB table. It is a simple but extremely powerful primitive which will enable developers to easily build solutions like cross-region replication, and to host additional materialized views, for instance an ElasticSearch index, on top of DynamoDB tables. In this session we will dive deep into details of Dynamo Streams, and how customers can leverage Dynamo Streams to build custom solutions and to extend the functionality of DynamoDB. We will give a demo of an example application built on top of Dynamo Streams to demonstrate the power and simplicity of Dynamo Streams.</span>
