					<span class="title">Cloud-Native Cost Optimization</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">For traditional data center applications, capacity is a fixed upfront cost. Thus, there is little incentive to stop using capacity once it's been allocated, and it has to be overprovisioned most of the time so there is enough capacity for peak loads. When traditional application and operating practices are used in cloud deployments, immediate benefits occur in speed of deployment, automation, and transparency of costs. The next step is a re-architecture of the application to be cloud-native, and significant operating cost reductions can help justify this development work. Cloud-native applications are dynamic and use ephemeral resources that customers are only charged for when the resources are in use. This talk will discuss best practices for cloud-native development, test, and production deployment architectures that turn off unused resources and take full advantage of optimizations such as reserved instances and consolidated billing.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Working with big volumes of data is a complicated task, but it's even harder if you have to do everything in real time and try to figure it all out yourself. This session will use practical examples to discuss architectural best practices and lessons learned when solving real-time social media analytics, sentiment analysis, and data visualization decision-making problems with AWS. Learn how you can leverage AWS services like Amazon RDS, AWS CloudFormation, Auto Scaling, Amazon S3, Amazon Glacier, and Amazon Elastic MapReduce to perform highly performant, reliable, real-time big data analytics while saving time, effort, and money.&nbsp; Gain insight from two years of real-time analytics successes and failures so you don't have to go down this path on your own.</span>

					<span class="title">Architecting Reactive Applications on AWS</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Application requirements have changed dramatically in recent years, requiring millisecond or even microsecond response times and 100 percent uptime. This change has led to a new wave of &quot;reactive applications&quot; with architectures that are event-driven, scalable, resilient, and responsive. In this session, we present the blueprint for building reactive applications on AWS. We compare reactive architecture to the classic n-tier architecture and discuss how it is cost-efficient and easy to implement using AWS. Next, we walk through how to design, build, deploy, and run reactive applications in the AWS cloud, delivering highly responsive user experiences with a real-time feel. This architecture uses Amazon EC2 instances to implement server push to broadcast events to application clients; AWS messaging (Amazon SQS/SNS); Amazon SWF to decouple system components; Amazon DynamoDB to minimize contention; and Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, Availability Zones, Amazon VPC, and Amazon Route 53 to make reactive applications scalable and resilient.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Whether you&rsquo;re a startup getting to profitability or an enterprise optimizing spend, it pays to run cost-efficient architectures on AWS. Building on last year&rsquo;s popular foundation of how to reduce waste and fine-tune your AWS spending, this session reviews a wide range of cost planning, monitoring, and optimization strategies, featuring real-world experience from AWS customer Adobe Systems. With the massive growth of subscribers to Adobe&rsquo;s Creative Cloud, Adobe&rsquo;s footprint in AWS continues to expand. We will discuss the techniques used to optimize and manage costs, while maximizing performance and improving resiliency. We&rsquo;ll cover effectively combining EC2 On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot instances to handle different use cases, leveraging auto scaling to match capacity to workload, choosing the most optimal instance type through load testing, taking advantage of multi-AZ support, and using CloudWatch to monitor usage and automatically shutting off resources when not in use. Other techniques we&rsquo;ll discuss include taking advantage of tiered storage and caching, offloading content to Amazon CloudFront to reduce back-end load, and getting rid of your back end entirely, by leveraging AWS high-level services. We will also showcase simple tools to help track and manage costs, including the AWS Cost Explorer, Billing Alerts, and Trusted Advisor. This session will be your pocket guide for running cost effectively in the Amazon cloud.</span>

In this session, you will learn how to architect different layers of your application―beginning with an extremely available front-end layer with Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling, and going all the way to a protected multitiered information layer, including cross-region replicas for relational and NoSQL databases. The concepts that we will share, using services like Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Route 53, will provide a framework you can use to keep your application running even with multiple failures. Additionally, you will hear from Magazine Luiza, in an interactive session, on how they run a large e-commerce application with a multiregion architecture using a combination of features and services from AWS to achieve extreme availability.</span>

					<span class="title">Maintaining a Resilient Front Door at Massive Scale</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">The Netflix service supports more than 50 million subscribers in over 40 countries around the world. These subscribers use more than 1,000 different device types to connect to Netflix, resulting in massive amounts of traffic to the service. In our distributed environment, the gateway service that receives this customer traffic needs to be able to scale in a variety of ways while simultaneously protecting our subscribers from failures elsewhere in the architecture. This talk will detail how the Netflix front door operates, leveraging systems like Hystrix, Zuul, and Scryer to maximize the AWS infrastructure and to create a great streaming experience.</span>

					<span class="title">Continuous Delivery at a Rate of 500 Deployments a Day!</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Every development team would love to spend more time building products and less time shepherding software releases. What if you had the ability to repeatably push any version of your code and not have to worry about the optimal server allocation for your services? This talk will cover how HubSpot and a team of 100 engineers deploys 500 times a day with very minimal effort. Singularity, an open-source project which HubSpot built from scratch, works with Apache Mesos to manage a multipurpose cluster in AWS to support web services, cron jobs, map/reduce tasks, and one-off processes. This talk will discuss the HubSpot service architecture and cultural advantages and the costs and benefits of the continuous delivery approach.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Some of the best businesses today are deploying their code dozens of times a day. How? By making heavy use of automation, smart tools, and repeatable patterns to get process out of the way and keep the workflow moving. Come to this session to learn how you can do this too, using services such as AWS OpsWorks, AWS CloudFormation, Amazon Simple Workflow Service, and other tools. We&rsquo;ll discuss a number of different deployment patterns, and what aspects you need to focus on when working toward deployment automation yourself.</span>

					<span class="title">From One to Many: Evolving VPC Design</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">As more customers adopt Amazon VPC architectures, the features and flexibility of the service are squaring off against increasingly complex design requirements. This session follows the evolution of a single regional VPC into a multi-VPC, multiregion design with diverse connectivity into on-premises systems and infrastructure. Along the way, we investigate creative customer solutions for scaling and securing outbound VPC traffic, managing multitenant VPCs, conducting VPC-to-VPC traffic, running multiple hybrid environments over AWS Direct Connect, and integrating corporate multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) clouds into multiregion VPCs..</span>
