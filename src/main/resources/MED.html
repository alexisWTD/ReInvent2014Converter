					<span class="title">Brazil's World Cup: Interacting with TV Viewers in Real-Time</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">For the World Cup hosted by Brazil, TV Globo created a live interactive experience with the viewer, providing live analysis and statistics about the match and the ability to interact with the TV anchor. The challenge was to do near real-time interaction with the viewer that was synchronized with the plays of the soccer match on the screen. This session explores how AWS and TV Globo combined Amazon EC2, Amazon EMR, ElastiCache, Auto Scaling, Amazon SQS, DynamoDB, Amazon RDS, CloudFront and more than 500 instances to make the experience possible.</span>

					<span class="title">Leveraging Cloud-Based Predictive Analytics to Strengthen Audience Engagement</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">In order to improve audience engagement., media companies must deal with vast amounts of raw data from web, social media, devices, catalogs, and back-channel sources.&nbsp; This session dives into predictive analytic solutions on AWS: We present architecture patterns for optimizing media delivery and tuning overall user experience based on representative data sources (video player clickstream, web logs, CDN, user profiles, social media sentiment, etc.). We dive into concrete implementations of cloud-based machine learning services and show how they can be leveraged for profiling audience demand, cueing content recommendations and prioritizing delivery of related media. Services covered include Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon EMR.</span>

					<span class="title">Secure Media Streaming and Delivery</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Media content, whether it be the latest blockbuster movie or a company&rsquo;s confidential webcasts, can be some of the most important assets for a media business. Storing, preparing, and delivering this content securely involves leveraging systems that can scale and ensure top-of-the-line security. Come find out how AWS can help you implement these workflows in the cloud using highly available, scalable, and secure cloud services such as Amazon S3 (storage), Amazon Elastic Transcoder (transcoding) and Amazon CloudFront (delivery). &nbsp;&nbsp;
We also discuss the underlying concepts of secure media delivery (e.g., policy-based DRM and signed URLs), the challenges faced by customers who need to design and implement these critical modules, and how to leverage the power of AWS to accomplish those while saving on costs. &nbsp;In addition, we take a deep dive into a media processing stack implemented on AWS using open source components to deliver encrypted HTTP Live Streams (HLS) to various devices.</span>

					<span class="title">The Future of Rendering: A Complete VFX Studio in the AWS Cloud</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Today&rsquo;s studios and visual effects companies require massive computing power and large amounts of storage to produce high-end digital scenes and videos. &nbsp;Maintaining the infrastructure required for these jobs is expensive and&nbsp;operationally difficult, plus demand fluctuates day to day. Geographically diverse workforces adds additional complexity to data and content transfer. The low-cost, utility computing model as well as unique virtualization capabilities offered by AWS are well-suited to addressing these challenges. In this session you will learn how to build and deploy a studio-quality, scalable Arnold render farm on AWS with reusable templates. We&rsquo;ll also demonstrate how to run Maya and Deadline remotely with AWS AppStream, and use them to edit scenes and coordinate render jobs entirely in the cloud.</span>

					<span class="title">Achieving Consistently High Throughput for Very Large Data Transfers with Amazon S3</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">A difficult problem for users of Amazon S3 that deal in large-form data is how to consistently transfer ultralarge files and large sets of files at fast speeds over the WAN. Although a number of tools are available for network transfer with S3 that exploit its multipart APIs, most have practical limitations when transferring very large files or large sets of very small files with remote regions. Transfers can be slow, degrade unpredictably, and for the largest sizes fail altogether. Additional complications include resume, encryption at rest, encryption in transit, and efficient updates for synchronization.
Aspera has expertise and experience in tackling these problems and has created a suite of transport, synchronization, monitoring, and collaboration software that can transfer and store both ultralarge files (up to the 5 TB limit of an S3 object) and large numbers of very small files (millions &lt; 100 KB) consistently fast, regardless of region.
In this session, technical leaders from Aspera explain how to achieve very large file WAN transfers and integrate them into mission-critical workflows across multiple industries. EVS, a media service provider to the 2014&nbsp;FIFA&nbsp;World Cup Brazil explains how they used Aspera solutions for the delivery of high-speed, live video transport, moving real-time video data from sports matches in Brazil to Europe for AWS-based transcoding, live streaming, and file delivery.
