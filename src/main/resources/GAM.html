					<span class="title">Scalable Game Architectures That Don't Break the Bank</span>
				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">In this session, AWS shares best practices for mobile, console, and MMO games that can scale from 1,000 to 1,000,000 users. See how to create a game backend using Amazon EC2 and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Learn about database scaling challenges, and how to use Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon ElastiCache to address them. And, hear how to deliver game assets efficiently using Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront. Then,&nbsp;hear from Roope Kangas, Lead Server Developer and co-founder at Grand Cru, about their journey launching and cost-optimizing&nbsp;Supernauts&nbsp;on AWS. Grand Cru used load testing to validate their system before launch, enabling them to reach 1 million users in 6 days. Then, after launch, the team optimized their architecture based on system metrics to cut their AWS costs by more than half.</span>
