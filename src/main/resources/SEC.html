				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">Security must be at the forefront for any online business.&nbsp;At AWS, security is priority number one. Stephen Schmidt, vice president and chief information officer for AWS, shares his insights into cloud security and how AWS meets our customers&rsquo; demanding security and compliance requirements, and in many cases helps them improve their security posture. Stephen, with his background with the FBI and his work with AWS customers in the government, space exploration, research, and financial services organizations, shares an industry perspective that's unique and invaluable for today's IT decision makers. At the conclusion of this session, Stephen also provides a brief summary of the other sessions available to you in the security track.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">AWS provides a number of tools and processes to help you decide when and how to move audited, regulated, and critical business data to the cloud. In this session, we answer the following questions: when is it time for you to make this significant move? When will you be ready to address industry best practices for control (including third-party audits, access control configurations, incident response, data sovereignty, and encryption). We discuss how some highly regulated AWS customers have addressed the challenges that legacy regulatory requirements present to partners, vendors, and customers in migrating to the AWS Cloud. Finally, we cover general trends we're seeing in several regulated industries leveraging AWS and the trends we&rsquo;re seeing from the regulators themselves who audit and accept AWS control environments.</span>

They need to know how to create an environment in AWS that enforces least-privilege access between components while also allowing administration and change management. Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) and Identity and Access Management (IAM), coupled with services like AWS Security Token Service (STS), offer the necessary building blocks.&nbsp; In this session, we walk through some of the mechanisms available to control access in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Next, we focus on using IAM and STS to create a least-privilege access model. Finally, we discuss auditing strategies to catch common mistakes and discuss techniques to audit and maintain your infrastructure.</span>

In this session, we will look at the identity disciplines, including authorization, identity governance and administration (IGA), provisioning, authentication and single sign-on&mdash;and their associated standards like XACML, SCIM, SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect, and FIDO. We will specify how these externalized identity functions can be integrated with AWS to deliver a cohesive organizational identity management framework. We will also cover real-world deployments of externalized identity systems with AWS.</span>

				</a>
        
				
					<span class="abstract">You've employed the practices outlined for incident detection, but what do you do when you detect an incident in the cloud? This session walks you through a hypothetical incident response on AWS. Learn to leverage the unique capabilities of the AWS environment when you respond to an incident, which in many ways is similar to how you respond to incidents in your own infrastructure. This session also covers specific environment recovery steps available on AWS.&nbsp;</span>
